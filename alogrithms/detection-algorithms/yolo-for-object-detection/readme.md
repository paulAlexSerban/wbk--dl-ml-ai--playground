# Do's & Don'ts in Data Collection and Labeling for Object Detection
- images from different sources and environments to make the model robust.
- with different lighting conditions, angles, and distances.
- with different backgrounds and occlusions.
- with different sizes and shapes of objects.
- with different orientations of objects.
- with different resolutions and aspect ratios.
- with different colors and textures.
- with different poses and expressions.
- with different scales and rotations.
- with different levels of noise and blur.
- with different types of objects and scenes.
- use HD images and videos for better quality and accuracy. - minimum resolution of 720p (1280x720 pixels).
- avoid using low-quality images and videos.
- avoid blurry, noisy, and distorted images and videos.
- avoid cluttered backgrounds and occlusions.
