# The Machine Learning Process
## Step 1: Data Pre-processing
- import data from libraries
- clean the data
- split the data into training and test sets (80% and 20%)

## Step 2: Modelling
- build the model
- train the model
- test the model
- make predictions

## Step 3: Evaluation
- calculate performance metrics
- make a verdict on the model
