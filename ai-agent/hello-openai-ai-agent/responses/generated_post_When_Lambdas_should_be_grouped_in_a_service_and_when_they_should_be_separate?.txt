When should you group Lambdas in a service?  
And when should they stand alone?

The answer depends on your goals:

If your Lambdas share common resources or state, grouping them simplifies deployment and management.

But if each Lambda has distinct responsibilities or scaling needs, keeping them separate offers better flexibility and fault isolation.

Design wisely—your architecture depends on it.
